# sysmon-cfg
This config file is geared towards Windows Server, currently specifically Server 2012 R2.  This file is built for a clean system install.  A lot of the config files that I found are geared more towards desktop utilization as they include browsers, adobe, java, Windows 10 features, app features, telemetry, etc.  This config file is designed to get everything one needs on a clean install, and rules based on what is specifically installed on the server it is used on.  THis file will elimate a lot of the default noise and catch all that is desired to be monitored.
